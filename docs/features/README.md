# Feature Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for new features.

## 🎯 Planning System

Use the `@plan` command in Cursor to generate comprehensive feature plans that include:

- 📋 **Feature Overview** - User stories and acceptance criteria
- 🏗️ **Technical Architecture** - Components, APIs, and state management
- 🎨 **UI/UX Design** - Skeleton UI components and Tailwind patterns
- 🧪 **Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, and visual tests
- 📈 **Implementation Phases** - TDD approach with quality gates
- ✅ **Definition of Done** - Completion criteria and quality checklist

## 📚 Current Feature Plans

## 🚀 How to Use

### Creating a New Plan

In Cursor chat, trigger feature planning with:

```
@plan [feature description]
```

**Examples:**

- `@plan add real-time price streaming to watchlist table`
- `@plan create symbol search with autocomplete functionality`
- `@plan implement dark mode theme switching`
- `@plan add portfolio value tracking dashboard`

### Planning Output

Each `@plan` command creates:

1. **Plan Document**: `docs/features/[FEATURE-NAME]-plan.md`
2. **Registry Update**: This README is updated with the new plan
3. **No Code**: Only documentation is created, never implementation

### Planning to Implementation Workflow

1. **📋 Planning**: Use `@plan` to create comprehensive documentation
2. **👀 Review**: Team reviews the plan document for completeness
3. **✅ Approval**: Plan is approved and ready for development
4. **🔨 Implementation**: Separate development session following the plan
5. **📦 Completion**: Feature is completed and plan is archived

## 📋 Plan Template

All feature plans follow the standardized template with these sections:

- **Feature Overview**: User story, acceptance criteria, success metrics
- **Technical Architecture**: Components, API integration, state management
- **UI/UX Design**: Skeleton UI usage, Tailwind patterns, accessibility
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, E2E tests, visual regression
- **Implementation Phases**: TDD approach with quality gates
- **File Structure**: Organized component and test layout
- **Risks & Considerations**: Technical and UX challenges
- **Definition of Done**: Quality checklist and completion criteria

## 🔧 Planning Standards

### Must Include

- ✅ **Skeleton UI Components**: Specify which components to use
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS Patterns**: Mobile-first responsive design
- ✅ **TypeScript Types**: Define data structures and interfaces
- ✅ **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and visual tests
- ✅ **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation
- ✅ **TDD Approach**: Test-first development methodology

### Project Integration

- 🎨 **Design System**: Use Skeleton UI design tokens
- 📱 **Responsive**: Mobile-first with Tailwind breakpoints
- ♿ **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard support
- 🧪 **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Use pnpm commands
- 🔒 **TypeScript**: Strict type safety

## ⚡ Quick Reference

### Planning Commands

- `@plan [description]` - Create comprehensive feature plan
- Review generated plan document
- Update plan status in this README
- Begin implementation in separate session

### File Organization

```
docs/features/
├── README.md                    # This file - plan registry
├── feature-name-plan.md         # Individual feature plans
└── archived/                    # Completed feature plans
    └── completed-feature-plan.md
```

### Quality Gates

Each plan must include:

- [ ] Clear user story and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Technical architecture with Skeleton UI
- [ ] Comprehensive testing strategy
- [ ] Accessibility requirements
- [ ] Implementation phases with TDD
- [ ] Definition of done checklist
