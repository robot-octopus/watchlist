# Tastytrade Watchlist App - Coding Challenge Submission

## 🎯 **Tastytrade Web Take Home Coding Challenge**

This is a submission for the Tastytrade web development coding challenge. The application implements a financial watchlist interface using SvelteKit and is designed to work with the Tastytrade Open API.

**Code Complete**: All components and API integration built  
**Tests Passing**: 108+ unit tests for components and business logic  
**API Issues**: Cannot verify core functionality due to endpoint problems

---

## ⚠️ **Current API Status & Known Issues**

**We cannot verify that core requirements are working due to API connectivity issues:**

1. **Authentication**: Login endpoints intermittently unavailable
2. **Streaming Data**: `{'error':{'code':'quote_streamer.customer_not_found_error','message':'You must be a customer to access a quote stream.'}}`
3. **Quote Updates**: Cannot confirm if watchlist tables actually receive real stock data
4. **Integration Tests**: Disabled due to API endpoint connectivity

**This means we cannot demonstrate that the application actually fulfills the core challenge requirements.**

## 🚀 **How to Start the App**

### **Local Development**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd watchlist
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:5173

### **Testing (What Actually Works)**

```bash
# Unit tests for components and logic
pnpm run test:unit

```

## 📋 **What Was Built (Code-wise)**

- **Framework**: SvelteKit 2.x with Svelte 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Skeleton UI
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

### **Working Tests (108+)**

```bash
pnpm run test:unit          # Component and logic tests
pnpm run test:visual        # Screenshot tests
pnpm run test:watch         # Development testing
```

### **Disabled Tests**

```bash
# Integration tests disabled due to API issues
# pnpm run test:integration   # Cannot test real API calls
```

### **Test Coverage**

- **Components**: All have unit tests
- **API Clients**: Mocked and tested
- **Business Logic**: Core functions tested
- **Real Integration**: Cannot be verified

## 🔧 **Development Commands**

```bash
pnpm install              # Install dependencies
pnpm run dev              # Start dev server (localhost:5173)
pnpm run test:unit        # Run unit tests
pnpm run build            # Production build
pnpm run lint             # Code quality check
```

## 📝 **Honest Assessment**

### **What Was Built**

- Complete component structure for a watchlist app
- Comprehensive unit test suite
- TypeScript implementation with proper types
- Modern UI with responsive design
- Proper error handling and loading states

### **What Cannot Be Verified**

- Core functionality due to API connectivity issues
- Whether the app actually fulfills challenge requirements
- Real-world usability with live market data

### **Current State**

This is a **code-complete implementation** that demonstrates the structure and approach for a financial watchlist application, but we cannot confirm it works with the actual Tastytrade API due to connectivity issues.

**Status**: Code complete, awaiting functional API endpoints for verification.
